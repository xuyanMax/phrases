I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck|真是差点忘带脑袋了
You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me Carrots.|不许再叫我萝卜头
Because if so, there's no shame in calling it quits. | 要是觉得别扭的话, 现在放弃还不丢人
One, I was never gonna let anyone see that `they got to me`.|我绝不让别人知道他们影响到了我
You laid it all out beautifully|你全盘招人了
