### Charaters

_Neo, Andreson_
_Morpheus_

_`You cannot scare me with his gestapo crap`_ 你盖世太保的行为吓不倒我

_`Like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad`_ 

_`You stay in wonderland, and I'll show you how deep the rabbit hole is.`_ 你待在爱丽丝仙境, 我将向你展示兔子洞有多深

_`Fate, it seems, is not without an irony`_ 命运看上去真的很讽刺

_That's the way these things go_ 事情就是这样发展的

_He almost had me convinced_ 他差点使我相信了

_Morpheus convinces you neo. And no one, not you, not even me can convince him otherwise_ 他相信你, 没有任何人, 包括你和我可信说服他相信其他人

_You have a good soul. And I hate giving good people bad news_ 我实在不愿意把坏消息给善良的人

_Morpheus means more to me than he does to your_ 对我而言比对你重要得多

_Sooner or later, you will notice there is a difference between knowing the path and waking the path_

_You haven't figured that out? Still using all the muscles except the one that matters_ 你还是那样, 四肢发达, 头脑简单?

_You remain irrevocably human_你仍然保持人性

_Your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the MATRIX_ 你的生命是母体程序中一些不等式的残留部分的总和

_You are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts, I've been unable to elimate you from the what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision_ 你是异常程序的最终形式, 无论我多努力, 都无法通过完美的数学公式将你移除, 否则的话, 母体就是一个精确数学的完美融合

_The onset of an emotion specifically designed to overwhelm logic and reason_ 特别设计的情感触发, 战胜理性和逻辑.

_An emotion that is already blinding you from the simple and obvious truth_ 情感蒙蔽了你的双眼, 使你无法看清显而易见的真相 

_Hope. It is the quinteseential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength and your greatst weakness_ 希望, 只是人类的幻想. 同时是人类最强大的力量也是最致命的弱点

 _While it remains a burden assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected and thus not beyond a measure of control._ 尽管这个无法避免, 但是我预料到了, 所以没让这个错误完全失控

 _The inevitability of its doom is apparent now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human_ 无法避免的毁灭是显而易见的, 人类天生不完美所造成的结果

 _So I redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesquueries of your nature_ 我以你的历史为基础, 重新设计更加准确表现人类丑陋的本性

 _If I am the father of the Matrix, she would undoubtebly be its mother._

 _Even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level._ 即使他们意识到这个选择差不多是无意识的

 _Denial is the most predictable of all human reponses_ 拒绝是人类最可预料的反应

 _But rest assured, this would be the sixth time we have destroyed it_ 但毫无疑问这将是我们第六次毁灭它
