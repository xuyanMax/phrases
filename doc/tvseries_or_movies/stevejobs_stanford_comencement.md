# Steve Job’s 2015 Stanford Commencement Address


3 stories.

## Connecting the dots.
He was adopted by a fake lawyer with higher education.

He went to Reed University at his 18 as promised, which was as expensive as Stanford. So he dropped out the school after one semester.  Because he didn’t see anything university can bring to him. He attended the calligraphy, where he learned sans serif and serif, varying amount of spaces between different letter combinations.

Later, they designed Macintosh, the first computer with beautiful typography. 
He regarded his success to the calligraphy class. 

Again, he said you cannot connect the dots looking forwards, you can only connect the dots by looking backwards. 

He said dropping school was the best choice he has ever made.

He said you have to believe in something, your gut, destiny, life karma or anything.

## Love and loss.

Started up Apple and was fired from Apple. Created another company NeXT and Pixar. Returned to Apple after Pixar bought by Apple. 

He said you gotta to love what you do. You got to find what you love. Working is ing to fill a large part of you life. So to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
 Keep moving and don’t settle.

## Death
Look into the mirror.

Live everyday as if it were your last day and someday you’ll most certainly be right. 

If it were the last day of your life, would you want to do what you are about to do today.

After several ‘No’ in row, you know you need to make some change.

Stay hungry, stay foolish. I have always wished that for myself.
