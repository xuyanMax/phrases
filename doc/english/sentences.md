## 倒装句型 (Inversion)

英文倒装句包含全倒装(所有谓语放在主语之前)和部分倒装(仅仅助动词或be动词放在主语之前). 

### 1. 当把否定词放句首时,句子是部分倒装,即只把助动词提前

`正常语序`

- I have never had a girlfriend. 
- I will never forgive you.

`助动词/情态动词 + 主语 + 动词`

- `Never` have I had a girlfriend. 
- `Never` will I forgive you.

#### 2.1 There be 结构. 
在此结构中可以用来代替be动词的动词有: 
- exist
- seem
- happen
- appear
- live 
- rise
- stand 等

例句: 
- `There stands` a palace under the foot of hill.

#### 2.2.1 在以here, there, now, then等副词开头的句子里. 句型 “副词 + vi + 名词主语”. 如果主语是人称代词, 主谓顺序不变, 不倒装.
